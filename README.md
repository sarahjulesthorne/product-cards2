# Product Cards  
### Description  
The project is an exercise in HTML and CSS. 5 products are hard-coded into the HTML and styled using CSS. The cards use various div, section, h, p, and img tags to share information about the products. Styles such as padding, box-shadow, text-align, etc. have been applied to form a very colorful page.
